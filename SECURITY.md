# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take security, accuracy, and integrity very seriously.

If you discover a security vulnerability or any critical issue that could compromise:
- User data
- Website stability
- Information authenticity
- Third-party copyrights

**Please report it confidentially** instead of publicly disclosing it.

### How to Report
- Email: m.maspero at umcutrecht.nl 
- Alternatively, open a private GitHub [Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories) if available for this repository.

Please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
- Any suggested fixes or mitigation ideas.

We will respond within **5 business days** and aim to resolve any verified security issues promptly.

## Scope

This project consists mainly of public, factual information.  
However, security reports are **in-scope** if they involve:
- Unauthorized access or modification of the repository
- Malicious code or dependency vulnerabilities
- Leakage of confidential contributor information
- Data integrity risks (e.g., tampering of commercial product descriptions)
- Misinformation that could lead to clinical safety risks

---

## Out of Scope

The following are *not* considered security vulnerabilities:
- Typos, broken links, or formatting issues
- Disagreements over interpretation of technical data
- Lack of endorsements or certifications from manufacturers

(These can be reported via regular GitHub Issues.)

---

## Disclosure Policy

We practice **coordinated disclosure**:
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report.
- We will work privately with you to understand and resolve the issue.
- We will publicly disclose security incidents only after a fix is available.
- You will be credited for responsible disclosure if desired.
