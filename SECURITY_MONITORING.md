# Security Monitoring Documentation

## Overview
DLinRT.eu implements comprehensive security monitoring to protect against various threats and ensure data integrity.

## Security Features

### 1. Rate Limiting
- **Contact Form**: 3 attempts per 5 minutes
- **Newsletter Signup**: Protected via database constraints
- **Analytics**: Graceful handling of duplicate visitor tracking

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict CSP headers prevent XSS attacks
- Only allows trusted sources for scripts and styles
- Blocks inline scripts and unsafe eval

### 3. Security Headers
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Forces HTTPS connections
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection`: Browser XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy`: Controls referrer information

### 4. Input Validation
- All forms use Zod schema validation
- Server-side validation in edge functions
- Sanitized database queries via Supabase client

### 5. Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Public access policies only where necessary
- Proper unique constraints to prevent duplicates

## Monitoring Procedures

### Security Event Logging
The system logs the following security events:
- Failed form submissions
- Rate limit violations
- Unusual activity patterns

### Response Procedures
1. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Automatic temporary blocking
2. **Failed Submissions**: Logged with security context
3. **Database Errors**: Graceful degradation with logging

## Security Configuration
