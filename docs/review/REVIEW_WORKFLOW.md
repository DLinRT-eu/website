- Update REVIEW_STATUS.md with review start
- Complete initial checklist review
- Document any immediate concerns

### 3. Deep Verification (3-5 days)
- Cross-reference all product claims
- Contact manufacturers for clarification if needed
- Document all verification sources
- Update product data with verified information

### 4. Peer Review (2-3 days)
- Another reviewer validates findings
- Technical accuracy check
- Clinical relevance verification
- Regulatory compliance confirmation

### 5. Final Documentation

- Create pull request with all changes
- Tag relevant stakeholders

## Communication Channels
