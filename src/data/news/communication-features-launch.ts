# Enhanced Communication: Mailing List and Contact Form Now Live

We're excited to announce the launch of two new communication features that will help strengthen our community and improve how we connect with users interested in deep learning solutions for radiotherapy.

## What's New

### Mailing List Subscription

### Contact Form
We've introduced a direct contact form that makes it easier for users to:

- Report issues or suggest improvements
- Submit feedback about the platform
- Request information about specific products or companies

## Privacy-First Approach

Both features are built with privacy at their core:

- **Explicit Consent Required**: We only collect personal data when you explicitly provide it and consent to its collection
- **Minimal Data Collection**: We collect only the information necessary to provide these services (email address and message content)
- **GDPR Compliant**: Full compliance with European data protection regulations
- **User Rights**: Easy unsubscribe options and the ability to request data deletion at any time
- **Transparent Processing**: Clear information about how we use your data, available in our updated privacy policy

## How to Access These Features

Both the mailing list subscription and contact form are available on our **Support & Contact** page. You can access them by:

1. Navigating to the Support page from the footer links
2. Scrolling to the respective sections
3. Following the simple signup or contact process

## Updated Privacy Policy

We've completely updated our privacy policy to reflect these new features and our commitment to data protection. The policy now clearly outlines:

- When and why we collect personal data
- How we use and protect your information
- Your rights regarding your personal data
- Our data retention policies
- How to contact us about privacy concerns

## Community Building

These communication features represent our commitment to building a stronger, more connected community around deep learning in radiotherapy. By enabling direct communication and regular updates, we can:

- Better understand user needs and priorities
- Share important developments more effectively
- Foster collaboration within the radiotherapy AI community
- Provide more responsive support and assistance

## Next Steps

We encourage all users interested in staying connected with the DLinRT community to:
