🚀 Launch Announcement: DLinRT Product Finder

We're excited to announce the launch of the **DLinRT Product Finder**, now live at [DLinRT.eu](https://dlinrt.eu/)!  
This initiative is inspired by the excellent work of the [Health AI Register](https://radiology.healthairegister.com/) and is designed to catalog **deep learning solutions in radiotherapy**, with a special focus on the **European market**.

> 🛠️ **Note**: The initial list and product details are already in place — but they still need review. This is just the beginning, and some information may not yet be fully up to date.

We've deliberately launched early to invite the **community to shape the platform from the start**, with the goal of showcasing the initiative at [ESTRO 2025](https://www.estro.org/Congresses/ESTRO-2025).

Development time has been minimal — just half a day so far — thanks to [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/). Now the real work (and fun!) begins: **opening the platform to the community for review and contributions.**
