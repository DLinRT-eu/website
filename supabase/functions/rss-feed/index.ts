    content: `# Enhanced Communication: Mailing List and Contact Form Now Live

We're excited to announce the launch of two new communication features that will help strengthen our community and improve how we connect with users interested in deep learning solutions for radiotherapy.

## What's New

### Mailing List Subscription
Stay updated with the latest developments in deep learning for radiotherapy through our new mailing list service.

### Contact Form
We've introduced a direct contact form that makes it easier for users to report issues, suggest improvements, and get in touch with our maintenance team.

## Privacy-First Approach
Both features are built with privacy at their core with explicit consent required, minimal data collection, GDPR compliance, and transparent processing.

Thank you for being part of the DLinRT community!`
